        content: 'I first started coding with C++ during the first semester of my undergraduate degree. To me, it was a brand new concept. I struggled in the beginning with \
            all the rules that I had to follow and some intermediate/advanced topics were very challenging. Python to me was like an oasis in the middle of a desert. I was mesmerized \
            by rather simple syntax, the variety of public libraries, and most importantly, a multitude of users in the Python community. I really enjoyed working on my side projects \
            with Python and every time when I encounter cool modules, I get amazed by what they can achieve.'
